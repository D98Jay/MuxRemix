# MuxRemix
MuOS's theme with standard layout. Based on OneTwo by bulkh.

### What does this have
- [x] Simple graphic
- [x] Light weight, fast theme switching
- [x] Bigger font size
- [x] Not language depend
- [x] Support all resolutions from MuOS
*1280x720 resolution is optimized for handheld (TRIMUI Smart Pro), it may look too big for HDMI output.

### Icons and Console images
I use icons and images from [OneTwo](https://github.com/bulkh/OneTwo) theme, as this theme is based on. Big shout out to bulkh!

### Theme Alternatives
Color schemes are based on default MustardOS theme, with a different style. Color constrast is boosted because the screen on these handheld is less vibrant than phone's screen.
